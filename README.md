## 👋 About Me

I am a Backend Software Engineer with **3.6+ years of experience** designing and building **production-grade, high-availability distributed systems**.

Currently, I work at **Oracle**, contributing to **5G Core architecture**, where system correctness, scalability, and strict protocol compliance are non-negotiable. My work involves solving real-world backend challenges such as concurrency control, resiliency, fault tolerance, and performance optimization.

I enjoy working close to the core of systems — where architecture decisions directly impact stability, latency, and business outcomes.
